# Naive-Bayes-Spam-Classifier
Using the Naive Bayes algorithm to create a model that can classify SMS messages as spam or not spam

Being able to identify spam messages is a binary classification problem as messages are classified as either 'Spam' or 'Not Spam' and nothing else. Also, this is a supervised learning problem, as we will be feeding a labelled dataset into the model, that it can learn from, to make future predictions.
